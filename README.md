## Vision & Purpose

Project Amplify is a civic technology tool designed to lower the barrier between intention and action, empowering individuals to advocate for human equality. It addresses a common challenge in citizen activism: many people care deeply about social issues but may not have the time, information, or confidence to effectively voice their concerns to elected officials.

This project was born from a passion for human rights and a belief in the power of technology to facilitate meaningful civic engagement. As an aspiring leader in Ethical and Responsible Technology, I built this tool to demonstrate a commitment to creating pro-social, human-centered products.

It showcases an understanding of:
* **Pro-Social Product Vision:** Conceptualizing and building technology that serves the public good.
* **User Empowerment:** Designing tools that make complex actions simple, accessible, and effective for the user.
* **Civic Tech Application:** Applying web development skills to solve real-world challenges in advocacy and social justice.

## Core Features

* **Issue Selection:** Users can choose from a curated list of critical human equality issues.
* **Dynamic Issue Briefing:** Upon selection, the tool provides a concise, educational summary of the chosen topic, including key facts and statistics to inform the user.
* **One-Click Letter Generation:** The application instantly generates a well-structured, compelling, and customizable letter addressed to a government representative.
* **"Copy to Clipboard" Functionality:** A simple, one-click button allows the user to easily copy the generated letter for use in an email or printable document.
* **Resource Hub:** Provides direct, verified links for users to find their specific elected officials.

## Featured Advocacy Issues

This toolkit is launching with a focus on three foundational principles of human equality:

* **Healthcare as a Human Right:** Advocating for policies that ensure universal access to quality healthcare.
* **Gender Equality:** Supporting initiatives that aim to close the wage gap and end gender-based discrimination.
* **Marriage Equality & LGBTQ+ Rights:** Championing the codification of federal protections for the LGBTQ+ community.

## Technology Stack

This is a pure front-end application built with fundamental web technologies, emphasizing accessibility and simplicity.
* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure and layout of the content.
* **CSS3:** For all custom styling, creating an empowering and trustworthy user interface.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Powers all of the application's logic, including dynamically generating content and handling user interactions.

The project is self-contained in a single file and has zero external dependencies.

## Future Enhancements

* **Expand Issues:** Add more advocacy topics to the toolkit.
* **API Integration:** Incorporate an API (like the Google Civic Information API) to allow users to find their specific representatives by entering their address.
* **Customization:** Allow users to save and manage their customized letters.
